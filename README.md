# scandirRecursive
A os.scandir implementation that supports recursiveness aswell as a maximum threshold depth in the recursiveness.
More or less same speed as os.list and os.walk (a bit slower) but has the advantage that my sacandir_recursive returns a list of os.DirEntry objects which is a big plus since it has a lot more information at hands reach and faster too since you don't need to call os.stat again. Also can optianally filter the outputted entries by several fields.

	Â· scandir_recursive(): A scandir implementation that allows recursiveness by level and returns a list of os.DirEntry objects.

	Depth starts at the maximum value and goes down by one in each function call until it reaches 0 where it doesn't call the function anymore.

	Returns a list of os.DirEntry objects.

	Call diagram for an example depth=1:
	```
	Original call depth=1
	finds a file -> add to list
	finds folder -> add to list
	depth > 0
	    Call function depth=depth-1=0
		finds a file -> add to list
		finds folder -> add to list
		depth not > 0
		    Doesn't call function
		Return list
	    Add the lists from last call to this call list
	Return list
	```
	If the depth is -1 execute maximum recursiveness.

	It takes a path, a depth level int (where -1 means max) and the optional filters:
		- mask: Filters the filenames with regular expressions
		- exts: Filter by extension. Takes a list of extensions you want in the form \['mp3','jpg'\]
		- folders: Don't show folders
		- files: Don't show files
		- hidden: Show and access hidden files and folders
		- min_len: Minimum filename length
		- max_len: Maximum filename length
	
treeSort(): Sort the list tree that scandir_recursive outputs alphabetically and case-insensitively the absolute paths, this will produce having a folder followed by its contents. When the depth=0 separate the tree into files and directories, sort each of them alphabetically case-insensitive, and then join them together again. Takes the tree list and the optional arguments:
	- depth: default value of -1
	- files_before_dirs: Only avaible for depth=0. If active will show files before directories
    
It doesn't follow symbolic links, returns a list of directories and a list of files (both ordered alphabetically and case-insensitively), can return the lists in absolutepaths (the default) or in basenames (considering removing this since you can always do it yourself if you want it).

Calling the script from terminal deploys a command utility much like the command "ls". Mainly for testing since its obviously worse as a command.

Benchmarks
----------
When running the benchmark that compares the os.walk method with this recursive scandir method, both starting from the root directory, the results are:
```
scandir_recursive (depth=0):
	time: 7.56e-05s
listdir (not recursive func):
	time: 3.43e-05s
--------------------------------------------------
scandir_recursive (depth=6):
	time: 1.98s
walk_limited (depth=6):
	time: 2.34s
--------------------------------------------------
scandir_recursive (max depth):
	time: 3.85s
walk (max depth):
	time: 3.72s
```

Also for comparison timing the command ls with max recursiveness
```
time sudo ls -AR "/" > /dev/null
```

```
real	0m2.130s
user	0m1.243s
sys	0m0.748s
```

Dependencies
